**📘 Master’s Thesis – Investigating the Application of Serverless Architecture in Building Scalable and Cost-Effective Full-Stack React Applications**

The project explores the practical adoption of serverless computing in full-stack applications by implementing a React-based to-do app on AWS using:

* AWS Lambda for backend functions
* API Gateway for routing
* DynamoDB for data persistence
* Cognito for authentication
* S3 for storage
* AWS SAM for deployment automation

Performance was evaluated using Artillery (backend load testing) and Dotcom-Monitor (end-to-end monitoring). Cost analysis was conducted using actual AWS billing data.

🎯 **Objectives**

* Evaluate scalability and latency of a serverless full-stack app under varying loads.
* Assess cost efficiency of serverless vs. traditional cloud setups.
* Examine developer experience (DX) when using serverless deployment models.
